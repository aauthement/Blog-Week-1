Informational Studies: Internet and Society Week 1

The Internet is such a complex networking system that has changed the way we think, act, communicate, and live. From the readings, it emphasizes on how the Internet is a revolutionary gateway in the technology industry. It is forever impacting our social, economic, and political societies. Before the Internet, there was the telegraph. The telegraph was very much neglected in a way because it actually produced industries and varieties of communication. There is little credit given to the way the telegraph began the electronic revolution, changed how we communicate and obtain knowledge, created the relationship between innovation and monopoly. (Carey, 2009). From that point on, the world was changed. Humans were now given the ability to interpret time, journalize our thoughts, and organize our government from one little invention. For example, like I already said, The Internet has essentially changed the way we communicate drastically. “This points, first, to the need to consider more carefully the relationship between language and technology.” (Gillespie, 2006, p. 450). Language conveys meaning and the way we communicate, whether in technology or not, is always adapted. 

In The Master Switch, the author says, “The oscillation of information industries between open and closed is so typical a phenomenon that I have given it a name: ‘the Cycle.’” (Wu, 2010, p. 6). Wu excellently provides us with the explanation of “the Cycle.” This is a cycle of breakthroughs in the corporate world that often starts with the exposure of failures. When an innovation is developed, it is popularized. The more it is mass consumed, the more exposure of failures is shown. To fix this, companies pursue to continuously fix the problem, and the cycle starts all over again. The openness and closedness of this can be seen, but raises the question about the Internet. The Internet remains diffused but if consolidated, then the Cycle will appear.

Another example of our innovative minds is through the creation of Low-tech Internet. Low-tech networks are usually connected with WIFI links, the same type of network for our mobile devices. (Low-Tech Magazine). The advantages come in many shapes and forms. The cheap capital costs and availability of a good amount of bandwidth allow long range WIFI to be in less developed countries as well. It is somewhat a metaphor with connecting these excluded countries with the rest of the world. In the end, WIFI has benefited our daily lives on social media, and the intuitive minds of people in poorer countries. 
The author Gillespie introduces us to the end-to-end principle. “The end-to-end principle essentially states that all knowledge about the specific needs of particular applications should be concentrated at the “end-points” of a network connection, that is, at the hosts that are communicating with each other; no other network components, such as routers, should need to know any of the details of application function or data structure in order to operate effectively.” (Dourish, 2015, p. 8). This shows how developed and innovative humans have gotten. The Internet has helped us grow in so many ways. Now, the Cycle will continue from to go on from there, or will the Internet defy the odds? What’s the next breakthrough?
